# MAGASIN Supervisor — SOURCE OF TRUTH

Status: **CANONICAL / SOLE PROJECT AUTHORITY**  
Approved by Owner: **2026-09-28**  
Architecture generation: **SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1**

## 0. Authority rule

This file is the **only canonical Source of Truth for the MAGASIN Supervisor project**.

Canonical path:

`/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`

Rules:

1. Runtime behavior, implementation planning, task status, architecture decisions, acceptance criteria, and recovery policy MUST be derived from this file.
2. No other Markdown, JSON, README section, issue, pull request, chat transcript, local state file, browser state, or conversation history may override this file.
3. Files whose names contain `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` anywhere else in the repository are historical/superseded unless this file explicitly promotes them.
4. README is navigation only. It is not project authority.
5. Git history and old architecture documents are evidence/reference only.
6. ChatGPT conversations are disposable execution surfaces. They are never durable project authority.
7. Local runtime state may store only the minimum transaction/recovery state needed to execute safely. It must not become a competing project database.

If any source conflicts with this file, **this file wins**.

---

## 1. Architecture decision

The former persistent Planner/Executor two-conversation architecture is superseded.

The canonical architecture is:

**Single Conversation + Disposable Chat + Persistent Source of Truth**

The Owner provides only the Source of Truth URL.

The Robot MUST NOT require the Owner to provide:
- Planner conversation URL;
- Executor conversation URL;
- Brain conversation URL;
- Work conversation URL;
- any historical ChatGPT conversation URL.

At any moment, the Robot operates on **at most one active ChatGPT conversation**.

A project may use multiple ChatGPT conversations over its lifetime, but only sequentially. A conversation is a temporary working surface and may be abandoned whenever it becomes inaccessible, stale, corrupted, too long, or otherwise unsafe to continue.

---

## 2. Canonical operating model

Normal flow:

```text
OWNER
  -> provides Source of Truth URL
ROBOT
  -> opens dedicated MAGASIN Chrome
  -> opens ChatGPT
  -> creates a fresh New Chat
  -> sends bootstrap instruction containing the Source of Truth
CHATGPT
  -> reads Source of Truth from the beginning
  -> determines current project state
  -> performs or plans the next bounded action
ROBOT
  -> waits until the response is complete
  -> clicks Continue generating if ChatGPT explicitly offers it
  -> waits again until complete
  -> verifies current Source of Truth
  -> sends the next instruction in the same conversation
  -> repeats
```

The current ChatGPT conversation is useful context only.

Before choosing the next project action after a meaningful state transition, the Robot MUST re-synchronize against the Source of Truth. Conversation memory must never override repository/project truth.

---

## 3. Conversation lifecycle

### 3.1 Start

On START:

1. verify the Owner has supplied one valid Source of Truth URL;
2. launch or attach to the dedicated MAGASIN Chrome profile;
3. verify ChatGPT authentication;
4. create or acquire one blank/new ChatGPT conversation;
5. persist only a runtime conversation handle/identity needed for the current live process;
6. send the canonical bootstrap message;
7. confirm that the bootstrap appears as a new user turn;
8. wait for a complete assistant response;
9. enter the normal execution loop.

No historical conversation URL is required for START.

### 3.2 Bootstrap intent

The first message in every newly created conversation MUST instruct ChatGPT to:

- read the Source of Truth from the beginning;
- treat it as the only project authority;
- ignore stale project state from prior conversations;
- determine current task/progress directly from the Source of Truth;
- continue only from current authoritative state;
- perform one bounded next unit of work or explain the current blocking condition.

The Robot SHOULD attach a unique runtime message/correlation id to bootstrap and subsequent Robot instructions so delivery can be reconciled exactly.

### 3.3 One active conversation

Steady state:

- target ChatGPT conversation count controlled by the Robot: **1**;
- max concurrent destructive UI mutations: **1**;
- no Planner/Executor relay;
- no cross-chat task handoff;
- no dependence on ChatGPT Work mode.

The Robot waits for the active conversation to finish before issuing another instruction.

### 3.4 Continue generating

If ChatGPT explicitly presents a valid Continue generating / Continue response control after a partial assistant answer:

1. ensure no send/composer mutation is in progress;
2. click Continue once;
3. wait for generation;
4. repeat only while the explicit continuation control remains valid;
5. do not send a new user prompt until the response is complete.

A Continue click is not equivalent to a new Robot instruction and does not advance project state by itself.

---

## 4. Disposable conversation recovery

A conversation is disposable.

If the active conversation:
- cannot load reliably;
- redirects to missing/access-denied state;
- loses its composer;
- repeatedly produces network/transient errors;
- becomes too long or unusable;
- cannot be safely reconciled after a Robot restart;

the Robot MUST prefer **conversation replacement** over indefinite recovery of the old URL.

Recovery flow:

```text
ACTIVE_CONVERSATION
  -> UNUSABLE
  -> preserve only safe transaction evidence
  -> close/retire current Robot conversation if safe
  -> create NEW CHAT
  -> bootstrap from SOURCE_OF_TRUTH
  -> rehydrate project state
  -> continue
```

The new conversation MUST NOT assume that the previous conversation completed unverified side effects. It must inspect Source of Truth and available evidence first.

Conversation rollover must not change the project identity.

---

## 5. Source of Truth discipline

The Source of Truth is durable project memory.

It must contain enough information for a fresh conversation with no prior chat history to determine:

- project goal;
- architecture;
- constraints;
- completed work;
- current work;
- next approved task;
- blocking dependencies;
- definition of done;
- acceptance evidence.

The Robot MUST re-read/reconcile Source of Truth:
- at every fresh conversation bootstrap;
- after completion of a bounded implementation task;
- before selecting a materially different next task;
- after restart/recovery when transaction outcome is uncertain.

The Robot MUST NOT use a conversation transcript as the sole proof that a task is complete.

---

## 6. Runtime transaction safety

The simplified architecture still requires exact-once safety for Robot-authored browser mutations.

Canonical send states:

```text
PREPARED
-> ENQUEUED
-> DELIVERED
-> RESPONSE_RUNNING
-> RESPONSE_COMPLETE
-> VERIFIED
```

For every Robot instruction:

- persist intent/correlation before replay-sensitive UI mutation;
- after Bridge/backend enqueue, persist the returned command/receipt id immediately;
- confirm the exact/new user turn before treating delivery as successful;
- if the user turn exists but no assistant response exists, wait rather than resend;
- resend only when positive evidence proves the prior instruction was not delivered;
- bounded retry only;
- ambiguous delivery must not create duplicate side effects.

A unique message id SHOULD be embedded in Robot-authored instructions so the active conversation can be reconciled after rerender/restart.

---

## 7. Canonical state machine

```text

  |
  '--> NEXT_WORK -> SEND_WORK

Any unrecoverable conversation fault:
  -> REPLACE_CHAT
  -> NEW_CHAT
  -> SYNC_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH
```

---

## 8. What is deleted from the forward architecture

The following are not forward requirements and MUST be removed or isolated as legacy/rollback code:

- persistent Planner URL;
- persistent Executor URL;
- exact two-chat topology;
- Planner/Executor role binding;
- Planner -> Executor -> Planner transport;
- two-chat Bridge page binding;
- target rollover between Planner and Executor;
- Owner requirement to paste chat URLs;
- project identity derived from chat target;
- recovery strategy centered on reopening an old conversation URL.

Historical code may remain temporarily while migration is in progress, but it must not be selected by the final production path.

---

## 9. What remains reusable

The implementation SHOULD reuse proven components where they still match this architecture:

- dedicated MAGASIN Chrome/profile boundary;
- CDP discovery/health validation;
- authenticated browser profile;
- safe ChatGPT UI probes;
- composer actuation;
- matching-new-user-turn send confirmation;
- Bridge/backend transport where useful;
- response-running detection;
- Continue-generating detection/control;
- bounded diagnostics;
- Owner STOP / AUTOSTART_DISABLED lifecycle authority;
- privacy-safe incident/status logging.

Reuse components, not obsolete orchestration semantics.

## 10. Implementation program

### SC-001 — Authority cleanup and contract lock
State: **COMPLETE**

Deliverables:
- establish `/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` as the sole authority;
- demote old Planner/Executor Source of Truth files to historical tombstones;
- make README point to one authority only;
- add regression/static checks preventing multiple files from declaring themselves canonical Source of Truth.

DoD:
- repository has exactly one forward document declaring project authority;
- no current README text contradicts this architecture.

Completion evidence:
- sole authority path: `/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`;
- former Planner/Executor Source of Truth files are historical tombstones;
- legacy Brain/Work directive protocol is explicitly historical/non-authoritative;
- `test/source-of-truth-authority.test.mjs` enforces the authority contract repository-wide;
- hosted Supervisor Tests and Supervisor Integrity are required for root `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` and `README.md` changes;
- PR #187 authority/static/full regression gates passed on the SC-001 candidate before completion was recorded.

### SC-002 — Single-conversation runtime state
State: **COMPLETE**

Replace Planner/Executor durable runtime shape with one active conversation session.

Minimum runtime state:
- project/session id;
- Source of Truth URL;
- active conversation runtime identity if available;
- conversation generation/rollover counter;
- pending outbound message correlation;
- send receipt/cmd id;
- delivery/response verification state;
- latest verified Source of Truth sync timestamp/revision where measurable;
- automation status/reason.

No saved conversation URL is required for future START.

DoD:
- runtime can start with Source of Truth only.

Completion evidence:
- canonical state schema: `single-conversation-state.v1`;
- canonical mode: `SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1`;
- state initialization accepts Source of Truth and does not accept or require Planner/Executor/chat URLs;
- durable state explicitly rejects `planner`, `executor`, conversation `url`, and conversation `target` fields;
- conversation state is generation-based and stores only disposable runtime/page identity;
- outbound transaction slots cover correlation, `cmd_id`, delivery and response verification metadata without making chat content project authority;
- Source of Truth verification metadata is explicit and contains no local project task/progress authority;
- `src/runtime/single-conversation-state-cli.mjs` proves state startup from Source of Truth only;
- `test/single-conversation-state.test.mjs` is included in hosted integrity and the full regression suite;
- PR #188 candidate passed Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Lifecycle Acceptance isolated and Autostart Install isolated before completion was recorded;
- production browser/New Chat actuation and Control Center cutover remain intentionally unselected until SC-003/SC-007.

### SC-003 — Robot-created New Chat bootstrap
State: **COMPLETE**

Implement:
- open ChatGPT landing surface;
- create a fresh conversation using UI behavior equivalent to a normal user New Chat;
- send canonical Source of Truth bootstrap;
- verify delivery and response.

DoD:
- from cold start with no chat URL, Robot creates one usable chat and receives a response.

Completion evidence:
- canonical implementation: `src/runtime/single-conversation-bootstrap.mjs`;
- qualification harness creates a true fresh ChatGPT New Chat without any Owner-provided conversation URL;
- bootstrap includes the sole Source of Truth URL and unique correlation id;
- durable state records PREPARED before UI mutation, confirms the exact new user turn, and reaches RESPONSE_COMPLETE only after a new assistant response;
- qualification response completion is correlation-aware so transient false-idle UI state cannot truncate the first assistant response;
- live qualification cleanup is bounded and exits explicitly so a durable PASS cannot be converted into a runner timeout by an attached CDP transport;
- SC-003 Live New Chat Qualification run #51 passed its target-machine attempt on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` and the aggregate `qualification-authority` gate passed;
- target evidence recorded `SC003_LIVE_FRESH_CHAT_CREATED=True`, `SC003_LIVE_MATCHING_USER_TURN_REQUIRED=True`, `SC003_LIVE_RESPONSE_COMPLETE=True`, `SC003_LIVE_ARCHITECTURE_GENERATION_CONFIRMED=True`, and `SC003_QUAL_QUALIFIED=True`;
- production project state and production conversation targets were not mutated by qualification;
- hosted Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Lifecycle Acceptance, and Autostart Install passed on the SC-003 candidate before completion was recorded.

### SC-004 — One-chat execution loop
State: **PLANNED**

Implement:
- wait for complete assistant response;
- handle explicit Continue generating;
- send next bounded instruction in the same chat;
- prevent concurrent sends;
- re-sync Source of Truth before material next-task selection.

DoD:
- multiple task cycles complete using one conversation and one active mutation at a time.

### SC-005 — Disposable-chat rollover
State: **PLANNED**

Implement deterministic replacement for:
- conversation missing/access denied;
- unrecoverable stale page;
- conversation-specific network failure;
- conversation too long/full;
- ambiguous page identity after restart.

DoD:
- Robot abandons an unusable chat, creates New Chat, rehydrates from Source of Truth, and resumes without Owner-provided chat links.

### SC-006 — Exact-once message receipt/reconciliation
State: **PLANNED**

Implement durable message state:
- PREPARED;
- ENQUEUED + persisted `cmd_id`;
- DELIVERED;
- RESPONSE_COMPLETE;
- VERIFIED.

Embed a unique Robot correlation id in outbound instructions.

DoD:
- crash at any point cannot cause an unbounded duplicate resend;
- positive non-delivery evidence permits a bounded safe resend.

### SC-007 — Control Center simplification
State: **PLANNED**

UI changes:
- keep Source of Truth input;
- remove Planner URL input;
- remove Executor URL input;
- remove chat-target rollover controls tied to old model;
- display current conversation generation/status as diagnostics only;
- START means “create/resume Robot session from Source of Truth,” not “open supplied conversations.”

DoD:
- Owner can operate Robot with Source of Truth + START/STOP only.

### SC-008 — Cold-start and failure qualification
State: **PLANNED**

Required acceptance matrix:
1. cold start, authenticated profile;
2. one fresh New Chat created automatically;
3. bootstrap delivered and answered;
4. Continue generating path works;
5. multiple sequential work cycles;
6. current chat intentionally broken -> automatic new chat rollover;
7. Robot restart during PREPARED/ENQUEUED/DELIVERED/WAIT_RESPONSE;
8. no duplicate unsafe mutation;
9. no Planner/Executor URLs required;
10. exactly one active Robot ChatGPT conversation in steady state.

Production cutover is allowed only when this matrix passes on the real self-hosted Windows runtime.

---

## 11. Current implementation status

As of 2026-09-28:

- dedicated Chrome/CDP startup has been observed healthy;
- Bridge has been observed with live ChatGPT pages;
- the old Planner/Executor runtime can fail at project bootstrap/reconciliation;
- the Owner has approved replacing persistent conversation links with Robot-created disposable conversations;
- the previous two-conversation architecture is therefore **superseded for forward development**;
- existing production/runtime code still contains Planner/Executor assumptions and must be migrated through SC-002..SC-008.

Until SC-008 passes, do not claim the new architecture is production-qualified.

---

## 12. Acceptance rule

The architecture is complete only when the following Owner-visible flow succeeds from a true cold start:

```text
Owner supplies Source of Truth
-> START
-> Robot opens dedicated Chrome
-> Robot opens ChatGPT
-> Robot creates New Chat
-> Robot asks ChatGPT to read Source of Truth
-> ChatGPT responds
-> Robot continues work in the same conversation
-> Robot handles Continue generating when needed
-> Robot verifies Source of Truth
-> Robot proceeds to next work
-> broken conversation can be replaced automatically
-> project can continue without any Owner-provided conversation URL
```

That end-to-end behavior, not an isolated unit test or manual debug session, is the final acceptance authority.
