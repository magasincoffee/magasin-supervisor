# MAGASIN Supervisor — SOURCE OF TRUTH

Status: **CANONICAL / SOLE PROJECT AUTHORITY**  
Approved by Owner: **2026-09-28**  
Architecture generation: **SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1**

## 0. Authority rule

This file is the **only canonical Source of Truth for the MAGASIN Supervisor project**.

Canonical path:

`/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`

Rules:

1. Runtime behavior, implementation planning, task status, architecture decisions, acceptance criteria, and recovery policy MUST be derived from this file.
2. No other Markdown, JSON, README section, issue, pull request, chat transcript, local state file, browser state, or conversation history may override this file.
3. Files whose names contain `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` anywhere else in the repository are historical/superseded unless this file explicitly promotes them.
4. README is navigation only. It is not project authority.
5. Git history and old architecture documents are evidence/reference only.
6. ChatGPT conversations are disposable execution surfaces. They are never durable project authority.
7. Local runtime state may store only the minimum transaction/recovery state needed to execute safely. It must not become a competing project database.

If any source conflicts with this file, **this file wins**.

---

## 1. Architecture decision

The former persistent Planner/Executor two-conversation architecture is superseded.

The canonical architecture is:

**Single Conversation + Disposable Chat + Persistent Source of Truth**

The Owner provides only the Source of Truth URL.

The Robot MUST NOT require the Owner to provide:
- Planner conversation URL;
- Executor conversation URL;
- Brain conversation URL;
- Work conversation URL;
- any historical ChatGPT conversation URL.

At any moment, the Robot operates on **at most one active ChatGPT conversation**.

A project may use multiple ChatGPT conversations over its lifetime, but only sequentially. A conversation is a temporary working surface and may be abandoned whenever it becomes inaccessible, stale, corrupted, too long, or otherwise unsafe to continue.

---

## 2. Canonical operating model

Normal flow:

```text
OWNER
  -> provides Source of Truth URL
ROBOT
  -> opens dedicated MAGASIN Chrome
  -> opens ChatGPT
  -> creates a fresh New Chat
  -> sends bootstrap instruction containing the Source of Truth
CHATGPT
  -> reads Source of Truth from the beginning
  -> determines current project state
  -> performs or plans the next bounded action
ROBOT
  -> waits until the response is complete
  -> clicks Continue generating if ChatGPT explicitly offers it
  -> waits again until complete
  -> verifies current Source of Truth
  -> sends the next instruction in the same conversation
  -> repeats
```

The current ChatGPT conversation is useful context only.

Before choosing the next project action after a meaningful state transition, the Robot MUST re-synchronize against the Source of Truth. Conversation memory must never override repository/project truth.

---

## 3. Conversation lifecycle

### 3.1 Start

On START:

1. verify the Owner has supplied one valid Source of Truth URL;
2. launch or attach to the dedicated MAGASIN Chrome profile;
3. verify ChatGPT authentication;
4. create or acquire one blank/new ChatGPT conversation;
5. persist only a runtime conversation handle/identity needed for the current live process;
6. send the canonical bootstrap message;
7. confirm that the bootstrap appears as a new user turn;
8. wait for a complete assistant response;
9. enter the normal execution loop.

No historical conversation URL is required for START.

### 3.2 Bootstrap intent

The first message in every newly created conversation MUST instruct ChatGPT to:

- read the Source of Truth from the beginning;
- treat it as the only project authority;
- ignore stale project state from prior conversations;
- determine current task/progress directly from the Source of Truth;
- continue only from current authoritative state;
- perform one bounded next unit of work or explain the current blocking condition.

The Robot SHOULD attach a unique runtime message/correlation id to bootstrap and subsequent Robot instructions so delivery can be reconciled exactly.

### 3.3 One active conversation

Steady state:

- target ChatGPT conversation count controlled by the Robot: **1**;
- max concurrent destructive UI mutations: **1**;
- no Planner/Executor relay;
- no cross-chat task handoff;
- no dependence on ChatGPT Work mode.

The Robot waits for the active conversation to finish before issuing another instruction.

### 3.4 Continue generating

If ChatGPT explicitly presents a valid Continue generating / Continue response control after a partial assistant answer:

1. ensure no send/composer mutation is in progress;
2. click Continue once;
3. wait for generation;
4. repeat only while the explicit continuation control remains valid;
5. do not send a new user prompt until the response is complete.

A Continue click is not equivalent to a new Robot instruction and does not advance project state by itself.

---

## 4. Disposable conversation recovery

A conversation is disposable.

If the active conversation:
- cannot load reliably;
- redirects to missing/access-denied state;
- loses its composer;
- repeatedly produces network/transient errors;
- becomes too long or unusable;
- cannot be safely reconciled after a Robot restart;

the Robot MUST prefer **conversation replacement** over indefinite recovery of the old URL.

Recovery flow:

```text
ACTIVE_CONVERSATION
  -> UNUSABLE
  -> preserve only safe transaction evidence
  -> close/retire current Robot conversation if safe
  -> create NEW CHAT
  -> bootstrap from SOURCE_OF_TRUTH
  -> rehydrate project state
  -> continue
```

The new conversation MUST NOT assume that the previous conversation completed unverified side effects. It must inspect Source of Truth and available evidence first.

Conversation rollover must not change the project identity.

---

## 5. Source of Truth discipline

The Source of Truth is durable project memory.

It must contain enough information for a fresh conversation with no prior chat history to determine:

- project goal;
- architecture;
- constraints;
- completed work;
- current work;
- next approved task;
- blocking dependencies;
- definition of done;
- acceptance evidence.

The Robot MUST re-read/reconcile Source of Truth:
- at every fresh conversation bootstrap;
- after completion of a bounded implementation task;
- before selecting a materially different next task;
- after restart/recovery when transaction outcome is uncertain.

The Robot MUST NOT use a conversation transcript as the sole proof that a task is complete.

---

## 6. Runtime transaction safety

The simplified architecture still requires exact-once safety for Robot-authored browser mutations.

Canonical send states:

```text
PREPARED
-> ENQUEUED
-> DELIVERED
-> RESPONSE_RUNNING
-> RESPONSE_COMPLETE
-> VERIFIED
```

For every Robot instruction:

- persist intent/correlation before replay-sensitive UI mutation;
- after Bridge/backend enqueue, persist the returned command/receipt id immediately;
- confirm the exact/new user turn before treating delivery as successful;
- if the user turn exists but no assistant response exists, wait rather than resend;
- resend only when positive evidence proves the prior instruction was not delivered;
- bounded retry only;
- ambiguous delivery must not create duplicate side effects.

A unique message id SHOULD be embedded in Robot-authored instructions so the active conversation can be reconciled after rerender/restart.

---

Any unrecoverable conversation fault:
  -> REPLACE_CHAT
  -> NEW_CHAT
  -> SYNC_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH
```

---

## 8. What is deleted from the forward architecture

The following are not forward requirements and MUST be removed or isolated as legacy/rollback code:

- persistent Planner URL;
- persistent Executor URL;
- exact two-chat topology;
- Planner/Executor role binding;
- Planner -> Executor -> Planner transport;
- two-chat Bridge page binding;
- target rollover between Planner and Executor;
- Owner requirement to paste chat URLs;
- project identity derived from chat target;
- recovery strategy centered on reopening an old conversation URL.

Historical code may remain temporarily while migration is in progress, but it must not be selected by the final production path.

---

## 9. What remains reusable

The implementation SHOULD reuse proven components where they still match this architecture:

- dedicated MAGASIN Chrome/profile boundary;
- CDP discovery/health validation;
- authenticated browser profile;
- safe ChatGPT UI probes;
- composer actuation;
- matching-new-user-turn send confirmation;
- Bridge/backend transport where useful;
- response-running detection;
- Continue-generating detection/control;
- bounded diagnostics;
- Owner STOP / AUTOSTART_DISABLED lifecycle authority;
- privacy-safe incident/status logging.

Reuse components, not obsolete orchestration semantics.

---

## 10. Implementation program

### SC-001 — Authority cleanup and contract lock
State: **COMPLETE**

Deliverables:
- establish `/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` as the sole authority;
- demote old Planner/Executor Source of Truth files to historical tombstones;
- make README point to one authority only;
- add regression/static checks preventing multiple files from declaring themselves canonical Source of Truth.

DoD:
- repository has exactly one forward document declaring project authority;
- no current README text contradicts this architecture.

Completion evidence:
- sole authority path: `/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`;
- former Planner/Executor Source of Truth files are historical tombstones;
- legacy Brain/Work directive protocol is explicitly historical/non-authoritative;
- `test/source-of-truth-authority.test.mjs` enforces the authority contract repository-wide;
- hosted Supervisor Tests and Supervisor Integrity are required for root `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` and `README.md` changes;
- PR #187 authority/static/full regression gates passed on the SC-001 candidate before completion was recorded.

### SC-002 — Single-conversation runtime state
State: **COMPLETE**

Replace Planner/Executor durable runtime shape with one active conversation session.

Minimum runtime state:
- project/session id;
- Source of Truth URL;
- active conversation runtime identity if available;
- conversation generation/rollover counter;
- pending outbound message correlation;
- send receipt/cmd id;
- delivery/response verification state;
- latest verified Source of Truth sync timestamp/revision where measurable;
- automation status/reason.

No saved conversation URL is required for future START.

DoD:
- runtime can start with Source of Truth only.

Completion evidence:
- canonical state schema: `single-conversation-state.v1`;
- canonical mode: `SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1`;
- state initialization accepts Source of Truth and does not accept or require Planner/Executor/chat URLs;
- durable state explicitly rejects `planner`, `executor`, conversation `url`, and conversation `target` fields;
- conversation state is generation-based and stores only disposable runtime/page identity;
- outbound transaction slots cover correlation, `cmd_id`, delivery and response verification metadata without making chat content project authority;
- Source of Truth verification metadata is explicit and contains no local project task/progress authority;
- `src/runtime/single-conversation-state-cli.mjs` proves state startup from Source of Truth only;
- `test/single-conversation-state.test.mjs` is included in hosted integrity and the full regression suite;
- PR #188 candidate passed Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Lifecycle Acceptance isolated and Autostart Install isolated before completion was recorded;
- production browser/New Chat actuation and Control Center cutover remain intentionally unselected until SC-003/SC-007.

### SC-003 — Robot-created New Chat bootstrap
State: **COMPLETE**

Implement:
- open ChatGPT landing surface;
- create a fresh conversation using UI behavior equivalent to a normal user New Chat;
- send canonical Source of Truth bootstrap;
- verify delivery and response.

DoD:
- from cold start with no chat URL, Robot creates one usable chat and receives a response.

Completion evidence:
- canonical implementation: `src/runtime/single-conversation-bootstrap.mjs`;
- qualification harness creates a true fresh ChatGPT New Chat without any Owner-provided conversation URL;
- bootstrap includes the sole Source of Truth URL and unique correlation id;
- durable state records PREPARED before UI mutation, confirms the exact new user turn, and reaches RESPONSE_COMPLETE only after a new assistant response;
- qualification response completion is correlation-aware so transient false-idle UI state cannot truncate the first assistant response;
- live qualification cleanup is bounded and exits explicitly so a durable PASS cannot be converted into a runner timeout by an attached CDP transport;
- SC-003 Live New Chat Qualification run #51 passed its target-machine attempt on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` and the aggregate `qualification-authority` gate passed;
- target evidence recorded `SC003_LIVE_FRESH_CHAT_CREATED=True`, `SC003_LIVE_MATCHING_USER_TURN_REQUIRED=True`, `SC003_LIVE_RESPONSE_COMPLETE=True`, `SC003_LIVE_ARCHITECTURE_GENERATION_CONFIRMED=True`, and `SC003_QUAL_QUALIFIED=True`;
- production project state and production conversation targets were not mutated by qualification;
- hosted Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Lifecycle Acceptance, and Autostart Install passed on the SC-003 candidate before completion was recorded.

### SC-004 — One-chat execution loop
State: **COMPLETE**

Implement:
- wait for complete assistant response;
- handle explicit Continue generating;
- send next bounded instruction in the same chat;
- prevent concurrent sends;
- re-sync Source of Truth before material next-task selection.

DoD:
- multiple task cycles complete using one conversation and one active mutation at a time.

Completion evidence:
- canonical implementation: `src/runtime/single-conversation-loop.mjs`;
- each next-work message re-reads the sole Source of Truth and carries a unique cycle correlation id;
- response completion is correlation-aware so transient false-idle assistant rendering cannot advance the loop early;
- explicit Continue generating is actuated only through the safe Continue control with a bounded click budget;
- durable cycle state advances through PREPARED / DELIVERED / RESPONSE_RUNNING / RESPONSE_COMPLETE and verifies Source of Truth before material next-task selection;
- shared composer transport includes bounded native-keyboard fallback and mixed legacy/modern user-turn reconciliation required by the current ChatGPT DOM;
- SC-004 Live One Chat Qualification run #9 passed its target-machine attempt on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` and the aggregate `qualification-authority` gate passed;
- live evidence recorded `SC004_LIVE_TWO_CYCLES_COMPLETE=True`, `SC004_LIVE_SINGLE_CONVERSATION_GENERATION=True`, `SC004_LIVE_RUNTIME_IDENTITY_PRESERVED=True`, `SC004_LIVE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_VERIFIED=True`, and `SC004_QUAL_QUALIFIED=True`;
- qualification detected a stale HTTP-only CDP health false-positive, used the existing one-shot dedicated-Chrome recovery semantics before any UI mutation, reattached successfully, and then completed both cycles;
- production project state was not mutated and qualification requested no external-system mutation;
- hosted Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Lifecycle Acceptance, and Autostart Install passed on the SC-004 candidate before completion was recorded.

### SC-005 — Disposable-chat rollover
State: **COMPLETE**

Implement deterministic replacement for:
- conversation missing/access denied;
- unrecoverable stale page;
- conversation-specific network failure;
- conversation too long/full;
- ambiguous page identity after restart.

DoD:
- Robot abandons an unusable chat, creates New Chat, rehydrates from Source of Truth, and resumes without Owner-provided chat links.

Completion evidence:
- canonical implementation: `src/runtime/single-conversation-rollover.mjs`;
- rollover retires the unusable active page and creates a fresh ChatGPT conversation without requiring any historical conversation URL;
- conversation generation advances monotonically and the replacement receives a new opaque runtime identity;
- replacement bootstrap rehydrates exclusively from the sole Source of Truth before work resumes;
- deterministic fault classification covers missing/access-denied, stale/unrecoverable page, conversation-specific network failure, conversation-full, and ambiguous page identity recovery boundaries;
- SC-005 Live Disposable Chat Rollover Qualification run #1 passed its target-machine attempt on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` and the aggregate `qualification-authority` gate passed;
- live evidence recorded `SC005_LIVE_CLOSED_PAGE_REPLACED=True`, `SC005_LIVE_GENERATION_ADVANCED_1_TO_2=True`, `SC005_LIVE_NEW_RUNTIME_IDENTITY=True`, `SC005_LIVE_REHYDRATED_FROM_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH=True`, and `SC005_LIVE_POST_ROLLOVER_CYCLE_COMPLETE=True`;
- qualification confirmed no conversation URL was persisted and no production project state or external system was mutated;
- hosted Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Lifecycle Acceptance, and Autostart Install passed on the SC-005 candidate before completion was recorded.

### SC-006 — Exact-once message receipt/reconciliation
State: **COMPLETE**

Implement durable message state:
- PREPARED;
- ENQUEUED + persisted `cmd_id`;
- DELIVERED;
- RESPONSE_COMPLETE;
- VERIFIED.

Embed a unique Robot correlation id in outbound instructions.

DoD:
- crash at any point cannot cause an unbounded duplicate resend;
- positive non-delivery evidence permits a bounded safe resend.

Completion evidence:
- canonical implementation: `src/runtime/single-conversation-transaction.mjs`;
- outbound intent and message digest are persisted at PREPARED before replay-sensitive UI mutation;
- ENQUEUED persists a stable `cmd_id` before browser actuation and carries a bounded retry counter;
- reconciliation searches exact correlated user-turn evidence across both legacy and current ChatGPT DOM surfaces rather than relying only on a stale latest-turn probe;
- a matching delivered user turn reconciles to DELIVERED without another send, while ambiguous post-send evidence fails closed across restart;
- positive non-delivery evidence permits at most one bounded safe retry in the qualified path;
- RESPONSE_COMPLETE must transition explicitly to VERIFIED, which also records Source of Truth verification;
- SC-006 Live Exact Once Qualification run #4 passed its target-machine attempt on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` and the aggregate `qualification-authority` gate passed;
- live evidence recorded `SC006_LIVE_PREPARED_ENQUEUED_DURABLE=True`, `SC006_LIVE_POSITIVE_NON_DELIVERY_SAFE_RETRY=True`, `SC006_LIVE_SAFE_RETRY_COUNT=1`, `SC006_LIVE_DELIVERED_NO_RESEND=True`, `SC006_LIVE_DUPLICATE_SEND_ATTEMPTS=0`, and `SC006_LIVE_VERIFIED_TERMINAL_STATE=True`;
- qualification confirmed no conversation URL was persisted and no production project state or external system was mutated;
- hosted Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Lifecycle Acceptance, and Autostart Install are required to pass on the final SC-006 candidate before merge.

### SC-007 — Control Center simplification
State: **COMPLETE**

UI changes:
- keep Source of Truth input;
- remove Planner URL input;
- remove Executor URL input;
- remove chat-target rollover controls tied to old model;
- display current conversation generation/status as diagnostics only;
- START means “create/resume Robot session from Source of Truth,” not “open supplied conversations.”

DoD:
- Owner can operate Robot with Source of Truth + START/STOP only.

Completion evidence:
- forward Control Center implementation: `windows/control-panel.ps1`;
- forward runtime entry point: `src/runtime/single-conversation-cli.mjs`;
- the default Control Center exposes Source of Truth, START ROBOT, STOP ROBOT, and single-conversation diagnostics only;
- Planner/Executor URL controls and chat-target rollover actions are absent from the forward Control Center and remain reachable only through an explicit legacy rollback flag;
- START persists `single-conversation-control.v1` with `mode=SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1` and `source_of_truth_url` only, with no persisted ChatGPT conversation URL;
- lifecycle truth and `run-supervisor.ps1` select `SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1` from the forward control record while preserving Planner/Executor and older runtimes as rollback/legacy paths;
- SC-007 Control Center Qualification run #2 passed on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` and the aggregate `qualification-authority` gate passed;
- target evidence recorded `SC007_QUAL_FORWARD_UI_CONTRACT=True`, `SC007_QUAL_SOURCE_ONLY_CONTROL=True`, `SC007_QUAL_LIFECYCLE_MODE=True`, `SC007_QUAL_RUNTIME_READY_FROM_SOT=True`, `SC007_QUAL_CHAT_URL_REQUIRED=False`, and `SC007_QUAL_QUALIFIED=True`;
- qualification used an isolated temporary state root and recorded `SC007_QUAL_PRODUCTION_STATE_MUTATED=False`;
- hosted Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Lifecycle Acceptance, and Autostart Install passed on the SC-007 candidate before completion was recorded.

### SC-008 — Cold-start and failure qualification
State: **COMPLETE**

Required acceptance matrix:
1. cold start, authenticated profile;
2. one fresh New Chat created automatically;
3. bootstrap delivered and answered;
4. Continue generating path works;
5. multiple sequential work cycles;
6. current chat intentionally broken -> automatic new chat rollover;
7. Robot restart during PREPARED/ENQUEUED/DELIVERED/WAIT_RESPONSE;
8. no duplicate unsafe mutation;
9. no Planner/Executor URLs required;
10. exactly one active Robot ChatGPT conversation in steady state.

Completion evidence:
- canonical live qualification harness: `.github/scripts/supervisor-sc008-live-qualification.mjs` and `.github/scripts/supervisor-sc008-live-qualification.ps1`;
- SC-008 Cold Start Failure Qualification run #11 passed on the real self-hosted Windows target `DESKTOP-4K7IM13`;
- the aggregate `qualification-authority` job passed and target evidence recorded `SC008_QUAL_QUALIFIED=True`;
- all ten acceptance-matrix checks recorded PASS: cold authenticated start, automatic fresh New Chat, bootstrap delivery/answer, Continue path, sequential cycles, automatic broken-chat rollover, restart reconciliation across PREPARED/ENQUEUED/DELIVERED/WAIT_RESPONSE, no duplicate unsafe mutation, no Owner-supplied Planner/Executor URL, and exactly one active Robot ChatGPT conversation in steady state;
- target evidence recorded `SC008_LIVE_STATUS=PASS`, `SC008_LIVE_PRODUCTION_PROJECT_STATE_MUTATED=False`, and `SC008_LIVE_EXTERNAL_SYSTEM_MUTATION_REQUESTED=False`;
- live qualification cleanup is bounded and exits explicitly so a completed PASS cannot be lost to an attached-CDP cleanup hang;
- Supervisor Tests, Supervisor Integrity, Supervisor Lifecycle Acceptance, and Supervisor Autostart Install passed on the final SC-008 runtime candidate before completion was recorded.

The required production-cutover matrix has passed on the real self-hosted Windows runtime.

### SC-009 — Production START wiring regression
State: **COMPLETE**

Incident evidence:
- on 2026-09-29, an actual Owner START on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` opened the dedicated ChatGPT Chrome but did not type or send the bootstrap;
- read-only live diagnostic confirmed `single-conversation-control.v1` with `mode=SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1`, one active Supervisor wrapper, dedicated Chrome online, but `single-conversation-state.json` absent and zero `single-conversation-cli.mjs` processes;
- the same diagnostic confirmed legacy `target.json` was absent, which is correct for the Source-of-Truth-only architecture;
- root cause: `windows/run-supervisor.ps1` incorrectly applied a legacy target-file gate to `SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1`, causing the wrapper to loop after opening Chrome and before launching the single-conversation runtime.

Completion evidence:
- `windows/run-supervisor.ps1` now exempts `SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1` from the legacy `target.json` gate while preserving the gate for legacy target-bound modes;
- `test/control-panel-single-conversation.test.mjs` locks the targetless forward START contract and confirms production launch includes `--execute`;
- hosted Supervisor Tests #1010, Supervisor Integrity #1024, Supervisor Lifecycle Acceptance #835, and Supervisor Autostart Install #865 passed on the fix candidate;
- the fixed candidate was installed on the real production target `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` without changing the existing single-conversation control record;
- SC-009 Production START Qualification run #1 passed its target-machine attempt and the aggregate `qualification-authority` job passed;
- target evidence recorded `SC009_LIVE_OWNER_START_INVOKED=True`, `SC009_LIVE_SINGLE_NODE_OBSERVED=True`, `SC009_LIVE_STATE_CREATED=True`, `SC009_LIVE_GENERATION=1`, `SC009_LIVE_BOOTSTRAP_VISIBLE=True`, `SC009_LIVE_ASSISTANT_RESPONSE_VISIBLE=True`, and `SC009_LIVE_PRODUCTION_START=PASS`;
- the live state ended with an ACTIVE conversation and RUNNING automation, proving the real Control Center/START -> wrapper -> single-conversation runtime -> ChatGPT bootstrap path now operates end to end.

The production START wiring regression is closed.

### SC-010 — NEXT_WORK stall recovery
State: **COMPLETE**

Incident evidence:
- on 2026-09-29, an actual Owner production run on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` completed bootstrap plus one bounded work cycle, then stopped issuing new work while Control Center still reported `AUTOMATION: RUNNING • phase=NEXT_WORK`;
- read-only live diagnostic at 2026-09-29T04:47:17Z confirmed exactly one Supervisor wrapper, exactly one `single-conversation-cli.mjs` process, healthy dedicated Chrome/CDP on port 9222, and exactly one active ChatGPT conversation;
- durable state had been unchanged since 2026-09-29T04:38:39Z with `conversation.status=ACTIVE`, `outbound.state=VERIFIED`, `automation.status=RUNNING`, and `automation.phase=NEXT_WORK`;
- the completed outbound transaction had no error code and had reached PREPARED -> ENQUEUED -> DELIVERED -> RESPONSE_RUNNING -> RESPONSE_COMPLETE -> VERIFIED.

Completion evidence:
- inter-cycle delay now uses a native runtime timer rather than a long-lived Playwright page RPC;
- NEXT_WORK recovery probe and baseline user/assistant capture are bounded by native deadlines; a hung UI/CDP step maps to deterministic wrapper recovery instead of remaining indefinitely in `RUNNING/NEXT_WORK`;
- runtime cleanup is bounded and the forward wrapper preserves exit-code-75 dedicated-Chrome recovery without replaying an already VERIFIED transaction;
- disposable recovery handles the page-close/probe race as a stale-page rollover;
- New Chat/bootstrap handling tolerates delayed composer hydration and preserves exact delivery evidence;
- newly created ChatGPT pages become the adapter's sticky active page so multi-cycle qualification cannot retain a stale warm-up tab as runtime identity;
- qualification-only continuity ignores descriptive DONE/BLOCKED text and runs to its fixed `maxCycles`, while normal production execution retains terminal-answer semantics;
- regression tests cover bounded NEXT_WORK recovery, native inter-cycle delay, deterministic recovery exit, page-close race, delayed composer hydration, and sticky active-page tracking;
- SC-010 NEXT_WORK Stall Qualification run #25 passed on the real target `DESKTOP-4K7IM13`;
- target evidence recorded `SC010_LIVE_FIVE_SEQUENTIAL_CYCLES=PASS`, `SC010_LIVE_FINAL_OUTBOUND_VERIFIED=True`, `SC010_LIVE_FINAL_PHASE_NEXT_WORK=True`, `SC010_LIVE_SOT_VERIFIED=True`, `SC010_LIVE_ACTIVE_CONVERSATION_COUNT=1`, `SC010_LIVE_GENERATION=1`, `SC010_LIVE_DUPLICATE_SEND_ATTEMPTS=0`, and `SC010_LIVE_STATUS=PASS`;
- target qualification recorded no production project-state mutation and no external-system mutation request, then restored the production Supervisor wrapper;
- aggregate `qualification-authority` passed with `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` as the qualified target;
- final runtime candidate `eac8091674f521835ab53b285e6e45d219c97264` passed Supervisor Tests #1059, Supervisor Integrity #1073, Supervisor Lifecycle Acceptance #884, and Supervisor Autostart Install #914 before completion was recorded.

The production NEXT_WORK stall is closed.

### SC-011 — Task-ID execution continuity and long-running work
State: **COMPLETE**

Owner-visible incident evidence:
- after SC-010, the Robot can still open a fresh ChatGPT conversation after a normal runtime process restart even when the current conversation is healthy;
- normal work instructions ask ChatGPT to re-read Source of Truth and choose the next action in free text, so the Robot has no explicit task identifier to transport between turns;
- production response timeout is 180 seconds, which is not sufficient for E2E or verification work that can take 30-60 minutes;
- terminal detection based on free-text keywords can stop the runtime even when words such as BLOCKED appear only descriptively.

Canonical forward contract:
1. ChatGPT selects exactly one authoritative task ID from Source of Truth; the Robot never invents or chooses the task.
2. The Robot copies that exact task ID into an execution instruction in the same active conversation.
3. Every production response ends with one machine-readable `MAGASIN_TASK_CONTROL_V1` block.
4. Long-running work may return `STATUS=RUNNING` with the same `TASK_ID` and a bounded `CHECK_AFTER_SECONDS`; the Robot waits with a native timer and checks the same task in the same conversation.
5. `STATUS=DONE` and `STATUS=BLOCKED` are terminal machine states; descriptive prose is not terminal authority.
6. A runtime restart reuses the current conversation only when its opaque runtime identity can be uniquely verified and the prior outbound transaction is at a safe boundary; otherwise disposable-chat replacement remains the recovery path.
7. Terminal completion/Owner wait pauses the wrapper instead of immediately starting another runtime session.

DoD:
- a normal process restart with one healthy verified conversation does not create a new Chat;
- the Robot executes the task ID returned by ChatGPT rather than issuing an unbounded generic NEXT_WORK instruction;
- a synthetic RUNNING -> CHECK -> COMPLETE path remains in one conversation without duplicate execution;
- direct assistant turns may be observed for up to 90 minutes, while durable external jobs are preferred for work expected to exceed about five minutes;
- terminal status causes wrapper pause and cannot be triggered by unrelated prose;
- unit/integrity/lifecycle/autostart gates pass;
- a live target qualification on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` proves one conversation generation survives at least one real CLI restart.

Completion evidence:
- production task transport uses the machine-readable `MAGASIN_TASK_CONTROL_V1` contract with `READY`, `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, `BLOCKED`, and `DONE` states;
- task execution copies the exact SOT task ID into `MAGASIN_EXECUTE_TASK_V1`; long-running work keeps the same task ID and is revisited with `MAGASIN_CHECK_TASK_V1` after `CHECK_AFTER_SECONDS`;
- free-text mentions of words such as BLOCKED/DONE no longer have terminal authority; only the parsed task-control block can stop or advance production;
- direct assistant response observation supports up to 90 minutes, while work expected to exceed about five minutes is instructed to launch a durable external job/run and return `STATUS=RUNNING` for bounded polling;
- a safe CLI restart first attempts unique opaque-runtime rebind to the existing verified ChatGPT conversation and only rolls over when that identity cannot be safely reconciled;
- terminal DONE/BLOCKED/protocol-invalid states map to intentional autonomy pause rather than wrapper relaunch;
- focused SC-011 protocol/runtime tests passed 14/14 on both target and non-target runners;
- SC-011 Task-ID Continuity Qualification run #13 passed on the real target `DESKTOP-4K7IM13`: `SC011_LIVE_CLI_RESTART_REUSED_CONVERSATION=True`, `SC011_LIVE_GENERATION_STABLE=1`, `SC011_LIVE_RUNTIME_ID_STABLE=True`, `SC011_LIVE_TOTAL_SEQUENTIAL_CYCLES=3`, `SC011_LIVE_MATCHED_RUNTIME_PAGE_COUNT=1`, `SC011_LIVE_DUPLICATE_SEND_ATTEMPTS=0`, and `SC011_LIVE_STATUS=PASS`;
- the same live qualification preserved Owner STOP, did not mutate production project state or request an external-system mutation, bounded CDP cleanup, closed the qualification chat, and exited explicitly instead of timing out after a durable PASS.

### SC-012 — Production restart replacement regression
State: **COMPLETE**

Owner-visible incident evidence:
- on 2026-09-29, a real production run on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` showed `conversation.generation=173` after repeated open/send/close/reopen behavior;
- bounded production diagnostic on the same target started from `generation=173`, healthy dedicated Chrome/CDP, and an ACTIVE conversation at a safe `RESPONSE_COMPLETE` boundary;
- restart rebind could not verify the prior opaque runtime identity and correctly selected disposable replacement with reason `RUNTIME_RESTART_IDENTITY_NOT_VERIFIED`;
- the replacement path then closed the currently attached ChatGPT page before acquiring a replacement page; when that page was the last tab in dedicated Chrome, Chrome/CDP terminated and bootstrap failed;
- durable state ended `conversation=RETIRED`, `automation=BLOCKED`, `phase=BOOTSTRAP_FAILED`, `outbound.last_error_code=BOOTSTRAP_FAILED`;
- the production wrapper treated generic runtime failure as retryable even after durable `automation.status=BLOCKED`, allowing repeated restart/replacement attempts and chat-generation churn.

Canonical fix:
1. disposable replacement MUST acquire/commit the new ChatGPT page before closing the retired page;
2. the retired page MUST be closed after replacement acquisition and before the new bootstrap mutation, preserving one active Robot conversation in steady state;
3. a durable single-conversation `automation.status=BLOCKED` after runtime exit is a fail-closed wrapper boundary and MUST stop automatic relaunch;
4. restart identity mismatch may still select disposable replacement, as required by SC-011, but one failed replacement MUST NOT create an unbounded rollover loop;
5. regression tests MUST lock replacement-before-close ordering and blocked-state wrapper pause;
6. final acceptance requires a real target run on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` proving restart/replacement no longer kills Chrome/CDP and does not advance conversation generation repeatedly.

DoD:
- replacement cannot close the final dedicated-Chrome page before a replacement page exists;
- a bootstrap/replacement failure reaches a bounded BLOCKED state without automatic wrapper churn;
- focused tests and hosted integrity/lifecycle gates pass;
- real production qualification on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` shows bounded generation growth and no repeated tab/chat creation.

Completion evidence:
- `src/runtime/single-conversation-rollover.mjs` now acquires/commits the replacement page before closing the retired page, so the last dedicated-Chrome tab is never closed before another page exists;
- `windows/run-supervisor.ps1` treats durable `automation.status=BLOCKED` as a fail-closed wrapper boundary and stops retry relaunch instead of creating chat churn;
- focused SC-012 regressions passed 22/22 on the real target before live qualification;
- hosted Supervisor Tests #1095, Supervisor Integrity #1109, Supervisor Lifecycle Acceptance #920, and Supervisor Autostart Install #950 passed on the final candidate;
- SC-012 Production Restart Replacement Qualification run #1 passed on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` and aggregate `qualification-authority` passed;
- target evidence recorded `SC012_LIVE_RESTART_FIXTURE_ONE_HOME_PAGE=True`, `SC012_LIVE_FORCED_IDENTITY_MISS=True`, `SC012_LIVE_REPLACEMENT_BEFORE_CLOSE=PASS`, `SC012_LIVE_CDP_SURVIVED_REPLACEMENT=True`, `SC012_LIVE_GENERATION_ADVANCED_EXACTLY_ONCE=2`, `SC012_LIVE_ACTIVE_CHATGPT_PAGE_COUNT=1`, `SC012_LIVE_FINAL_OUTBOUND_VERIFIED=True`, and `SC012_LIVE_STATUS=PASS`;
- qualification mutated no production project state, requested no external-system mutation, installed the exact qualified candidate on the target, and preserved Owner STOP.

### SC-013 — Legacy orchestration retirement and stuck composer recovery
State: **IN PROGRESS**

Owner-visible incident evidence:
- on 2026-09-30, a real production run on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` sent one message, then visibly populated the ChatGPT composer but did not submit it for more than 30 minutes;
- live state inspection showed `conversation=ACTIVE`, `automation=BLOCKED`, `phase=SEND_WORK`, `outbound=ENQUEUED`, `delivered_at=null`, while the live ChatGPT page had an enabled composer containing 878 characters and an enabled `Gửi` button;
- the submit diagnostic recorded `COMPOSER_NOT_READY` even though the live composer was editable and Send was enabled;
- strict outbound digest and the contenteditable draft digest differed because ChatGPT ProseMirror can encode visible multiline paragraph boundaries structurally, so `textContent` can collapse rendered line boundaries and produce a false non-persistence result;
- the same production merge automatically triggered obsolete Planner/Executor-era workflows on `main`, including PE-001, PE-007, and the legacy Brain submit diagnostic; these jobs consumed the real self-hosted target and interfered with forward production deployment/diagnostics.

Canonical fix:
1. forward production MUST use only `SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1`; obsolete Planner/Executor/Brain/Bridge qualification or cutover workflows MUST NOT auto-run from `main` or consume the production target;
2. legacy source may remain only as inert historical/rollback reference where still needed, but active GitHub Actions orchestration for the superseded architecture must be removed from `.github/workflows`;
3. contenteditable composer verification MUST use rendered-equivalent text identity for current ChatGPT ProseMirror while retaining strict durable message digests for exact-once transaction authority;
4. an `ENQUEUED` transaction with no delivered user turn may resume only when exact or rendered-equivalent evidence proves the live draft belongs to the same Robot message;
5. successful safe reconciliation MUST clear transient `BLOCKED` state and return automation to `RUNNING`;
6. final acceptance requires real target evidence on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` that the blocked outbound is either safely delivered or safely reconstructed, a matching user turn appears, a response completes, and at least two subsequent task-control cycles continue in the same active conversation without duplicate sends or legacy workflow interference.

### SC-013 live first-failure progression rule

For SC-013 production debugging, the Robot MUST use a real production-length workload and advance strictly one blocking stage at a time:

1. run the real production path on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13`, not a shortened synthetic prompt as acceptance evidence;
2. identify the first blocking stage reached by the live run;
3. fix only that first blocking stage; do not bundle speculative fixes for later unproven stages into the same recovery iteration;
4. rerun the real production path from the beginning after that single-stage fix;
5. if the run advances and then blocks at a later stage, treat that later stage as the next independent repair iteration;
6. continue until the full Owner-visible flow and SC-013 DoD pass without special-case test shortcuts;
7. unit tests may protect a proven fix, but they cannot replace the subsequent real production rerun.

The live transaction stages used for this progression are, in order where applicable: PREPARED -> ENQUEUED -> COMPOSER_READY/TEXT_PERSISTED -> SUBMIT_ACTUATED -> DELIVERED -> RESPONSE_COMPLETE -> VERIFIED -> NEXT_WORK. A failure report must identify the earliest proven failing stage before implementation is changed.

### SC-013 unattended observation policy

While SC-013 remains IN PROGRESS, production evidence collection is unattended:
- `.github/workflows/sc013-runtime-watchdog.yml` samples the real `DESKTOP-4K7IM13` runtime every five minutes without sending ChatGPT messages;
- the watchdog records wrapper/CDP health, conversation state, outbound state, retry count, automation status/phase/reason, and bounded PREPARED/ENQUEUED stall age;
- explicit Owner STOP is authoritative and is not treated as a fault;
- when a non-Owner fault is detected and CDP remains reachable, the watchdog runs the read-only rebind/composer diagnostic so the first failing stage and live ChatGPT draft are preserved in GitHub Actions evidence;
- the watchdog MUST NOT repair or send by itself; repair still follows the SC-013 first-failure rule, with tests and exact-main deployment before the production rerun;
- SC-013 remains IN PROGRESS until the required same-conversation multi-cycle production evidence is sustained without BLOCKED state, duplicate sends, or legacy workflow interference.

DoD:
- PE-001, PE-007, legacy Brain submit/repair, and superseded Bridge qualification/cutover workflows cannot auto-run on `main`;
- current composer text is not falsely rejected solely because ProseMirror rewrites equivalent whitespace/paragraph structure;
- exact-once protection still rejects a genuinely different draft;
- the production target completes the previously stuck outbound without duplicate delivery;
- the Robot continues for at least two additional bounded cycles in the same conversation with stable generation;
- hosted tests/integrity/lifecycle/autostart gates pass;
- production evidence is recorded before SC-013 is marked COMPLETE.

## 11. Current implementation status

As of 2026-09-30:

- SC-001 through SC-012 are complete;
- SC-013 is IN PROGRESS following a real production stuck-send incident and discovery of legacy Planner/Executor workflows still auto-running on main;
- the canonical forward runtime is **SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1**;
- the Owner supplies the Source of Truth URL only; no historical ChatGPT conversation URL is required;
- the forward Control Center and runtime use one disposable Robot-created ChatGPT conversation at a time;
- the actual production START wiring has been requalified on `DESKTOP-4K7IM13`;
- automatic replacement, exact-once reconciliation, Continue handling, cold-start recovery, bounded NEXT_WORK recovery, task-ID execution, safe same-chat restart rebind, and continuous multi-cycle execution have passed their required live qualifications;
- the real target completed the SC-011 restart-continuity qualification in one stable conversation generation with zero duplicate send attempts and Source of Truth verification preserved;
- long-running 30-60 minute E2E/verification tasks are supported through durable RUNNING/CHECK polling, with a 90-minute direct response ceiling when no durable external job is available;
- persistent Planner/Executor orchestration remains superseded and is legacy/rollback-only, not a forward production dependency.

The forward architecture remains **SINGLE_CONVERSATION_V1**, but unattended production acceptance is temporarily **OPEN** until SC-013 closes the stuck-send and legacy-workflow interference regressions with new real-target evidence.

---

## 12. Acceptance rule

The architecture is complete only when the following Owner-visible flow succeeds from a true cold start:

```text
Owner supplies Source of Truth
-> START
-> Robot opens dedicated Chrome
-> Robot opens ChatGPT
-> Robot creates New Chat
-> Robot asks ChatGPT to read Source of Truth
-> ChatGPT responds
-> Robot continues work in the same conversation
-> Robot handles Continue generating when needed
-> Robot verifies Source of Truth
-> Robot proceeds to next work
-> broken conversation can be replaced automatically
-> project can continue without any Owner-provided conversation URL
```

That end-to-end behavior, not an isolated unit test or manual debug session, is the final acceptance authority.
